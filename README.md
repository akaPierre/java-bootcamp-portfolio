# Java Bootcamp Portfolio

> **30 days • 14 projects • from beginner to advanced**

This repository is a curated portfolio of my **Java learning journey**, built during an intensive bootcamp-style roadmap. It starts with simple console programs and evolves into **production-style Spring Boot systems**, touching areas like **security, networking, blockchain, and AI integration**.

The goal of this portfolio is not just to show finished projects, but to demonstrate **progression, consistency, and real-world problem solving** using Java.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

Throughout this bootcamp, I worked hands-on with:

- Core Java fundamentals and OOP principles
- Console applications and clean input/output handling
- JavaFX and Swing for GUI development
- Spring Boot 3 and RESTful API design
- JWT-based authentication and security concepts
- Networking, sockets, and multithreading
- Cryptography fundamentals and blockchain concepts
- AI integration using LLM APIs
- Maven for build and dependency management
